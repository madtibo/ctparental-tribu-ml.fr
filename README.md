# CTparental Gnome Shell extension

Simple [CTparental](https://github.com/marsat/CTparental) shell extension for Gnome 3.

## Install

Current validated Gnome shell version: 3.22

Please tell me if this extension is functional on other versions.

### Install from Gnome extensions

Visit the CTParental page on : https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1384/ctparental/

### Manual installation for testing and development

To install just symlink the checkout folder into `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/` as `ctparental@tribu-ml.fr`. It looks something like this:

```sh
cd ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/
ln -s /path/to/the/checkout ctparental@tribu-ml.fr
```

After that you can enable the extension and change the preferences using Tweak Tool, or on https://extensions.gnome.org/local/
